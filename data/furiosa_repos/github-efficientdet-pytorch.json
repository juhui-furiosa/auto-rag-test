Either their approach didn't fit my aim to correctly reproduce the Tensorflow models (but with a PyTorch feel and flexibility) or they cannot come close to replicating MS COCO training from scratch.\nAside from the default model configs, there is a lot of flexibility to facilitate experiments and rapid improvements here -- some options based on the official Tensorflow impl, some of my own:\nBiFPN connections and combination mode are fully configurable and not baked into the model code\nBiFPN and head modules can be switched between depthwise separable or standard convolutions\nActivations, batch norm layers are switchable via arguments (soon config)\nAny backbone in my\ntimm\nmodel collection that supports feature extraction (\nfeatures_only\narg) can be used as a bacbkone.",

The result is either a model that fails to converge, or appears to converge (training loss) but the eval loss (running BN stats) is garbage.
