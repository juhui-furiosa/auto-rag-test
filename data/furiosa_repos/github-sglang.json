        "text": "SGLang is a fast serving framework for large language models and vision language models.\nIt makes your interaction with models faster and more controllable by co-designing the backend runtime and frontend language.\nThe core features include:\nFast Backend Runtime\n: Provides efficient serving with RadixAttention for prefix caching, zero-overhead CPU scheduler, prefill-decode disaggregation, speculative decoding, continuous batching, paged attention, tensor/pipeline/expert/data parallelism, structured outputs, chunked prefill, quantization (FP4/FP8/INT4/AWQ/GPTQ), and multi-lora batching.\nFlexible Frontend Language\n: Offers an intuitive interface for programming LLM applications, including chained generation calls, advanced prompting, control flow, multi-modal inputs, parallelism, and external interactions.\nExtensive Model Support\n: Supports a wide range of generative models (Llama, Qwen, DeepSeek, Kimi, GPT, Gemma, Mistral, etc.), embedding models (e5-mistral, gte, mcdse) and reward models (Skywork), with easy extensibility for integrating new models.\nActive Community\n: SGLang is open-source and backed by an active community with wide industry adoption.",
