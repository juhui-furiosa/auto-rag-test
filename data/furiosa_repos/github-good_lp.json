For instance:\nyou can maximise\n3 * x + y\n, but not\n3 * x * y\n.\nContinuous and integer variables\n. good_lp itself supports mixed integer-linear programming (MILP),\nbut not all underlying solvers support integer variables.\nNot a solver\n. This crate uses other rust crates to provide the solvers.\nThere is no solving algorithm in good_lp itself. If you have an issue with a solver,\nreport it to the solver directly. See below for the list of supported solvers.",
