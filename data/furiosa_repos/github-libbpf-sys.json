For example, the\n0.6.x\nreleases of this crate provides the API for the\nlibbpf v0.6.x\nreleases.\nIn order to allow for human error, the \"Patch\" semver number is used by this crate and does not necessarily match the provided\nlibbpf\nversion. For example, both the\n0.6.1\nand\n0.6.2\nreleases of this crate contain bindings to\nlibbpf v0.6.1\n, but the later release contains bugfixes and/or enhancements to the crate itself.\nThe exact version of\nlibbpf\nthat is provided by any given release can be found in the \"Build Metadata\" semver section, which comes after the\n+\nin the version string. For example,\n0.6.2+v0.6.1\nindicates that the crate version is\n0.6.2\nand the upstream\nlibbpf\nversion is\nv0.6.1\n.",
