At the same time, each python module defining an architecture is fully standalone and can be modified to enable quick research experiments.\n🤗 Transformers is backed by the three most popular deep learning libraries —\nJax\n,\nPyTorch\nand\nTensorFlow\n— with a seamless integration between them. It's straightforward to train your models with one before loading them for inference with the other.",
