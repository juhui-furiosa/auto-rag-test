Our latest version of Llama is now accessible to individuals, creators, researchers and businesses of all sizes so that they can experiment, innovate and scale their ideas responsibly.\nThis release includes model weights and starting code for pretrained and fine-tuned Llama language models — ranging from 7B to 70B parameters.\nThis repository is intended as a minimal example to load\nLlama 2\nmodels and run inference. For more detailed examples leveraging Hugging Face, see\nllama-recipes\n.",

It's critical to do all of these in case you have local corrupt files.\nIn order to download the model weights and tokenizer, please visit the\nMeta website\nand accept our License.\nOnce your request is approved, you will receive a signed URL over email. Then run the download.sh script, passing the URL provided when prompted to start the download.\nPre-requisites: Make sure you have\nwget\nand\nmd5sum\ninstalled. Then to run the script:\n./download.sh\n.\nKeep in mind that the links expire after 24 hours and a certain amount of downloads. If you start seeing errors such as\n403: Forbidden\n, you can always re-request a link.",

You will need this URL when you run the download.sh script.\nOnce you get the email, navigate to your downloaded llama repository and run the download.sh script.\nMake sure to grant execution permissions to the download.sh script\nDuring this process, you will be prompted to enter the URL from the email.\nDo not use the “Copy Link” option but rather make sure to manually copy the link from the email.\nOnce the model/s you want have been downloaded, you can run the model locally using the command below:\ntorchrun --nproc_per_node 1 example_chat_completion.py \\\n    --ckpt_dir llama-2-7b-chat/ \\\n    --tokenizer_path tokenizer.model \\\n    --max_seq_len 512 --max_batch_size 6\nNote\nReplace\nllama-2-7b-chat/\nwith the path to your checkpoint directory and\ntokenizer.model\nwith the path to your tokenizer model.\nThe\n–nproc_per_node\nshould be set to the\nMP\nvalue for the model you are using.\nAdjust the\nmax_seq_len\nand\nmax_batch_size\nparameters as needed.\nThis example runs the\nexample_chat_completion.py\nfound in this repository but you can change that to a different .py file.",
