        "text": "MLflow is a platform to streamline machine learning development, including tracking experiments, packaging code\ninto reproducible runs, and sharing and deploying models. MLflow offers a set of lightweight APIs that can be\nused with any existing machine learning application or library (TensorFlow, PyTorch, XGBoost, etc), wherever you\ncurrently run ML code (e.g. in notebooks, standalone applications or the cloud). MLflow's current components are:\nMLflow Tracking\n: An API to log parameters, code, and\nresults in machine learning experiments and compare them using an interactive UI.\nMLflow Projects\n: A code packaging format for reproducible\nruns using Conda and Docker, so you can share your ML code with others.\nMLflow Models\n: A model packaging format and tools that let\nyou easily deploy the same model (from any ML library) to batch and real-time scoring on platforms such as\nDocker, Apache Spark, Azure ML and AWS SageMaker.\nMLflow Model Registry\n: A centralized model store, set of APIs, and UI, to collaboratively manage the full lifecycle of MLflow Models.",
