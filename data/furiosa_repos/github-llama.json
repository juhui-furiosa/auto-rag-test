Our latest version of Llama is now accessible to individuals, creators, researchers and businesses of all sizes so that they can experiment, innovate and scale their ideas responsibly.\nThis release includes model weights and starting code for pretrained and fine-tuned Llama language models — ranging from 7B to 70B parameters.\nThis repository is intended as a minimal example to load\nLlama 2\nmodels and run inference. For more detailed examples leveraging HuggingFace, see\nllama-recipes\n.",

Anyone still encountering issues should remove all local files, re-clone the repository, and\nrequest a new download link\n. It's critical to do all of these in case you have local corrupt files. When you receive the email, copy\nonly\nthe link text - it should begin with\nhttps://download.llamameta.net\nand not with\nhttps://l.facebook.com\n, which will give errors.\nIn order to download the model weights and tokenizer, please visit the\nMeta AI website\nand accept our License.\nOnce your request is approved, you will receive a signed URL over email. Then run the download.sh script, passing the URL provided when prompted to start the download. Make sure that you copy the URL text itself,\ndo not use the 'Copy link address' option\nwhen you right click the URL. If the copied URL text starts with:\nhttps://download.llamameta.net\n, you copied it correctly. If the copied URL text starts with:\nhttps://l.facebook.com\n, you copied it the wrong way.\nPre-requisites: make sure you have\nwget\nand\nmd5sum\ninstalled. Then to run the script:\n./download.sh\n.\nKeep in mind that the links expire after 24 hours and a certain amount of downloads. If you start seeing errors such as\n403: Forbidden\n, you can always re-request a link.",
