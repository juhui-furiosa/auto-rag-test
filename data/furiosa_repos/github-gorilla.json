Given a natural language query, Gorilla comes up with the semantically- and syntactically- correct API to invoke.\nWith Gorilla, we are the first to demonstrate how to use LLMs to invoke 1,600+ (and growing) API calls accurately while reducing hallucination. This repository contains\ninference code\nfor running Gorilla finetuned models,\nevaluation code\nfor reproducing results from our paper, and\nAPIBench\n- the largest collection of APIs, curated and easy to be trained on!\nSince our initial release, we've served ~500k requests and witnessed incredible adoption by developers worldwide.

            "text": "I would like to use Gorilla commercially. Is there going to be an Apache 2.0 licensed version?\nYes! We now have models that you can use commercially without any obligations.\nCan we use Gorilla with other tools like Langchain etc?\nAbsolutely! You've highlighted a great aspect of our tools. Gorilla is  an  end-to-end model, specifically tailored to serve correct API calls (tools) without requiring any additional coding. It's designed to work as part of a wider ecosystem and can be flexibly integrated within agentic frameworks and other tools.\nLangchain, is a versatile developer tool. Its \"agents\" can efficiently swap in any LLM, Gorilla included, making it a highly adaptable solution for various needs.\nThe beauty of these tools truly shines when they collaborate, complementing each other's strengths and capabilities to create an even more powerful and comprehensive solution. This is where your contribution can make a difference. We enthusiastically welcome any inputs to further refine and enhance these tools.\nCheck out our blog on\nHow to Use Gorilla: A Step-by-Step Walkthrough\nto see all the different ways you can integrate Gorilla in your projects.",
