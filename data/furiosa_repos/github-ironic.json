It can be\nused with nova as a hypervisor driver, or standalone service using bifrost.\nBy default, it will use PXE and IPMI to interact with bare metal machines.\nIronic also supports vendor-specific plug-ins which may implement additional\nfunctionality.\nIronic is distributed under the terms of the Apache License, Version 2.0.
