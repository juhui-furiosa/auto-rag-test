            "text": "SystemC addresses the need for a system design and verification language that\nspans hardware and software.  It is a language built as an ANSI C++ class\nlibrary created for design and verification.  Users worldwide are applying\nSystemC to system-level modeling, abstract analog/mixed-signal modeling,\narchitectural exploration, performance modeling, software development,\nfunctional verification, and high-level synthesis.  The SystemC API and\nits semantics are developed by the\nAccellera Systems Initiative\nand\nformally standardized and governed by the IEEE in the\nIEEE Std. 1666-2023\nstandard.\nThis version of SystemC is the\nreference implementation\nprovided by\nthe\nAccellera Systems Initiative\nand is mainly developed by the following\nAccellera Working Groups\nSystemC Language Working Group\n(LWG)\nSystemC Datatypes Working Group\n(SDTWG)\nIn the event of discrepancies between the behavior of this implementation and\nstatements made in the\nIEEE Std. 1666-2023\nstandard, the IEEE standard\nshall be taken to be definitive.\nIf you would like to contribute to this repository,\nplease check the\nCONTRIBUTING.md\nfile.",

The SystemC LWG is responsible for\nthe definition and development of the SystemC and TLM core languages, the\nfoundation on which all other SystemC libraries and functionality are built.\nParticipants of both working groups include member companies and industry\ncontributors.
