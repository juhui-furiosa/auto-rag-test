For detailed instructions on installing packages, drivers, and the Furiosa SDK, please see the following:\nDriver, Firmware and Runtime Installation\n(\nEnglish\n|\n한국어\n)\nThis project requires Python 3.9 or above. You can install the required Python packages using pip as follows,\npip install -r requirements.txt\nand install required packages for post processing utilities using apt. Then, build C++ post processing utilities.\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install cmake libeigen3-dev\n./build.sh\nBefore installing the project, please make sure to check\nCHECK\nflags and set them to your own paths if you are using your own dataset. If you downloaded the coco2017 dataset with\ncoco2017.sh\n, you can skip this step. So for convenience, please use the\ncoco2017.sh\nscript to download the dataset.\nAfter verifying the settings, install the project using pip.\npip install\n.\nAfter installation, you can use the\nwarboy-vision\ncommand-line interface (CLI).\nYou can view all available CLI commands by running:\nwarboy-vision --help\nFor detailed usage information about a specific command, use:\nwarboy-vision\n<\ncommand\n>\n--help",
