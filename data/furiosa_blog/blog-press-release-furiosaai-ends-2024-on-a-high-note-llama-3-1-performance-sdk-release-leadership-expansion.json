  "content": "SANTA CLARA, California, December 19, 2024— FuriosaAI , an emerging leader in AI semiconductor solutions, is closing out the year with rapid technical and customer progress with its flagship chip, RNGD (pronounced 'Renegade'). The recently announced AI solution has achieved compelling performance metrics in real-world enterprise deployments, meeting the demand for inference with advanced large language models (LLMs) and multimodal models.\n\nThe new performance benchmarks prove RNGD's ability to meet industry-leading throughput demands for Llama 3.1 models, including the 8B and 70B variants, with additional optimizations already in progress. The company also announced key software features that bring advanced optimization for customers currently sampling RNGD hardware in their production environments. These achievements represent the first phase of Furiosa's vision for AI infrastructure that overcomes the inherent limitations of GPUs.\n\nRNGD delivers winning throughput metrics with Llama 3.1 8B and 70B :\n\nWith RNGD 's AI-native Tensor Contraction Processor (TCP) architecture, Furiosa is redefining real-world AI deployments, delivering unmatched performance, programmability, and power efficiency. Furiosa’s RNGD recently achieved a throughput of 3,200 to 3,300 tokens per second (TPS) when running Llama 3.1-8B. In single-user scenarios, RNGD consistently delivers 40 TPS to 60 TPS\n\nAdditionally, RNGD demonstrates exceptional power efficiency, consuming 180W per card, with further optimization efforts underway. Rather than excessively boosting per-user performance, the company aims to maintain performance levels exceeding typical text-reading speeds (10 TPS to 20 TPS or higher) while optimizing for multi-user environments and achieving balanced performance.\n\nFuriosa is advancing the performance and efficiency of Llama 3.1-70B. With just two RNGD cards, LLaMA 3.1-70B can be executed effectively. Currently, a single server supports up to 100 concurrent user queries, with ongoing optimizations aiming to achieve 8,000 TPS per server when equipped with eight RNGD cards.\n\nWith the release of SDK v2024.3.0, Furiosa will expand the range of its preloaded models. The SDK will also include support for tensor parallelism, enabling seamless processing across multiple elements without requiring model modifications, and torch.compile, providing the foundation for executing custom models. Integration with HuggingFace Optimum will further empower customers to leverage a broader variety of models.\n\nAdvanced optimization tools delivered to early RNGD customers:\n\nBuilding on these milestones, domestic and global enterprise customers are conducting tests with Furiosa to find a more efficient solution for scaling the inference of their self-developed models, compared to their existing setup. Their objective is to manage TCO effectively as they prepare for large-scale AI adoption. Furiosa plans to provide a high-quality AI development environment through a powerful and user-friendly SDK optimized for RNGD. SDK v2024.1.0, currently available through the Early Access Program (EAP), is designed to handle high performance processing of multiple LLM serving requests. It incorporates optimization techniques such as PagedAttention, Block KV Cache, and Continuous Batching, while also supporting various token sampling methods, including Greedy, Beam Search, and Top-k/p. These features allow developers to seamlessly create AI services customized to meet a wide range of requirements. The SDK and online sample will be available after the release of v2024.3.0.\n\nFuriosa remains committed to delivering the most sustainable AI deployment solutions through rigorous optimization at an unprecedented pace.\n\n\"With RNGD now in customers’ hands, we are accelerating the next generation of frontier LLMs to unlock emerging Agentic AI applications—bringing advanced reasoning capabilities to enterprise verticals, all at dramatically lower costs,\" said June Paik, co-founder and CEO of FuriosaAI.\n\nFuriosa Expands Global Footprint with Strategic Leadership Appointment\n\nFuriosa is scaling production and expanding its leadership team with the appointment of Alex Liu as Senior Vice President of Product and Business. A Technology Emmy Award winner and co-founder of NETINT Technologies, Alex brings over 20 years of expertise in startup management, technology innovation, and strategic leadership. At NETINT, he spearheaded groundbreaking achievements, including the development of the world’s first VPU SoC, setting new industry benchmarks and securing the prestigious 2024 Technology Emmy Award. At Furiosa, Alex will lead global product management, go-to-market strategies, and partnerships to drive innovation and align the company’s AI-native technologies with a vision to empower the development of planet-scale AI infrastructure.\n\nRNGD is currently sampling with customers, and mass production will ramp up in partnership with TSMC for 2025 availability.
