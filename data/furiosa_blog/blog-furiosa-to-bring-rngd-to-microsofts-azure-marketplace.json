  "content": "Access to powerful AI hardware shouldn’t be a barrier to innovation. That’s why we built our flagship AI accelerator, RNGD, to address the real-world needs of businesses using LLMs and multimodal models at scale. It’s also why we’re excited to announce today that we are bringing RNGD to Microsoft’s Azure Marketplace.\n\nMicrosoft’s Azure Marketplace is an online store that provides applications and services for use on Azure. Enterprise customers interested in using RNGD will be able to easily take advantage of the productive and trusted Azure cloud platform, with streamlined deployment and management.\n\nOur goal is to enable Azure Marketplace customers to seamlessly use RNGD to:\n\nDeploy production-ready inference endpoints to RNGD in minutes\n\nDeploy production-ready inference endpoints to RNGD in minutes\n\nScale inference infrastructure up or down based on demand\n\nScale inference infrastructure up or down based on demand\n\nLeverage their existing Azure data and software stack with RNGD\n\nLeverage their existing Azure data and software stack with RNGD\n\n“Through the Microsoft Azure Marketplace, customers around the world can easily find, buy, and deploy partner solutions they can trust, all certified and optimized to run on Azure,” said Jake Zborowski, General Manager, Microsoft Azure Platform at Microsoft. “We’re happy to welcome Furiosa RNGD to the growing Azure Marketplace ecosystem.”\n\nMaking enterprise AI simple and efficient\n\nThe first product release of our Azure integration focuses on immediate usability, and we plan to soon provide a set of APIs for inference on RNGD using precompiled Llama 3.1 models (the version of Llama currently most requested by our enterprise customers). This will enable organizations to instantly test and take advantage of RNGD’s efficiency and performance within their existing workflows.\n\nAs we ramp up RNGD production and add support for additional model architectures, Furiosa will use Azure’s cloud infrastructure to build out and scale the RNGD software stack, making it easy for Azure cloud users to use.\n\nThe power of choice\n\nThis Azure integration represents a major milestone in our mission to make efficient LLM and multimodal inference accessible to everyone. Organizations can now choose the RNGD deployment model that best fits their needs:\n\nCloud-first teams can get started immediately through Azure Marketplace.\n\nCloud-first teams can get started immediately through Azure Marketplace.\n\nOrganizations with on-premises requirements can deploy RNGD in their own data centers.\n\nOrganizations with on-premises requirements can deploy RNGD in their own data centers.\n\nHybrid deployments can leverage both options as their needs evolve.\n\nHybrid deployments can leverage both options as their needs evolve.\n\nThis integration delivers on our core mission: making sustainable AI infrastructure accessible to everyone, from startups to enterprises. Whether you're deploying your first LLM or scaling to serve millions of users, RNGD on Azure Marketplace will remove complexity while delivering the performance and efficiency you need.\n\nRNGD is currently sampling with enterprises as we work with our foundry partner, TSMC, to ramp up production for mass availability in late 2025.\n\nWant to be among the first to experience RNGD on Azure?
