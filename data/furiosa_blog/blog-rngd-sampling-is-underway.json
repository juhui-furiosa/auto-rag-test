  "content": "Six weeks after unveiling RNGD (“Renegade”) at Hot Chips and just five months after receiving our first raw silicon samples from TSMC, we’re excited to share updates about our first PoCs underway now.\n\nEarlier this month, FuriosaAI delivered servers equipped with RNGD, our second-gen chip for data center inference, to one of our early access partners – a multinational technology corporation based in Seoul.\n\nSeveral other customers are already sampling RNGD or preparing to receive RNGD servers for testing with their models. (We’ll share more about those evaluations soon.)\n\nRNGD is built for high-performance, highly efficient data center inference with large language models (LLMs) and multimodal models. The chip went into production this summer and is now running advanced models like Meta’s Llama 3.1 70B at full speed using Furiosa’s RNGD software stack.\n\n“I'm really proud of our team for the rapid RNGD bring-up, and I’m excited to kick off an important new chapter of customer sampling,” said Furiosa co-founder and CEO June Paik. “There’s much more to do to establish RNGD as the best inference solution, but we are racing forward quickly.” (Just look at June’s hair blowing in the wind in the photo below.)\n\nOver the coming weeks and months, these customers will test RNGD’s performance in demanding real-world applications, where latency, throughput, and energy consumption are all crucial considerations.\n\nInitial feedback has been very positive, but we have more work to do to demonstrate the chip’s capabilities. Our APAC Tech Sales Director, Yungbum Jung (he’s the one without the flowy hair in the photo), and his team will work closely with customers to onboard them smoothly and collect their feedback.\n\nAccelerating development of our AI accelerator\n\nOur goal has been to bring RNGD to market as quickly as possible, and we plan to keep up the pace.\n\nAdditionally, RNGD is now installed in two other data centers, the Artificial Intelligence Industry Cluster Agency (AICA) and the National IT Industry Promotion Agency (NIPA), through the K-Cloud led by the Korean government. And since cloud vendors play a key role in supplying advanced AI compute to businesses, we are preparing to work with leading providers to sample RNGD in their deployments. Earlier this month, Aramco announced the signing of an MoU with Furiosa.\n\nWe’ll provide updates on these evaluations soon. And our engineering team is preparing to share more technical details about RNGD soon, including third-party benchmarks.\n\nSign up here to get updates on RNGD or reach out to us to learn more.\n\nFuriosa CEO June Paik and APAC Tech Sales Director Yungbum Jung."
