  "content": "The problem with AI inference today\n\nRunning large language models (LLMs) and multimodal models in production today is difficult, expensive, or both. Even setting aside the substantial upfront costs of obtaining a fleet of high-performance GPUs, businesses must contend with eye-popping electricity bills, complex and costly liquid cooling systems, and server room infrastructure that was never designed to accommodate cards that consume 1,000 watts or more each.\n\nEnter RNGD: The chip you actually want in your data center\n\nRNGD is our answer to these problems. (It’s pronounced “Renegade,” by the way. Apologies if you were thinking “RUHN-ga-dah” in your head.)\n\nHere's what RNGD delivers:\n\nEfficiency : 180W TDP. The GPU in your gaming PC probably uses more power.\n\nEfficiency : 180W TDP.

That's why most chips excel in one or two areas but fall flat in the third.\n\nWe built RNGD from the ground up to nail this balance, starting with a new chip architecture called the Tensor Contraction Processor (TCP). (Spoiler: It turns out that matrix multiplication isn’t all you need.) We also incorporated cutting-edge technology like HBM3 and a 5nm node.\n\nReal-world benefits (the stuff that actually matters)\n\nLower Total Cost of Ownership : Spend less on energy bills, server infrastructure, and hardware. Your customers, investors, and CFO will thank you.\n\nLower Total Cost of Ownership : Spend less on energy bills, server infrastructure, and hardware.

Visit our RNGD product page and sign up here for benchmark performance stats and other updates. We will have much more to share soon.\n\nAnd if you’re attending Hot Chips in person this week, please come by our booth and say hi. We’ll be the ones in T-shirts that look like they could be inspired by a Scandinavian metal band.\n\nSign up here to be notified first about RNGD availability and product updates."
