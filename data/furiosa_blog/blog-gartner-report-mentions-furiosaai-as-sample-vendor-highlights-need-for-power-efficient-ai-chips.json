GB/s ?\n\nNo. The key thing is ROI , according to a recent AI industry report by Gartner, the famed research and advisory firm.\n\nIn “ Emerging Tech: Adoption Trends for Energy-Efficient GenAI Semiconductors, ” Gartner singles out operational costs as a “major force” now shaping how businesses are adopting AI.\n\n“Operational effectiveness and cost reduction will force early adoption of energy-efficient generative AI hardware technology,” Gartner’s analysts conclude. In other words, businesses are focusing on return on their AI hardware investments. (The entire report, which is based on 50+ interviews with 31 providers globally along with 90+ use-case studies, is available to Gartner customers here .)\n\nThe report lists FuriosaAI as a Sample Vendor, alongside legacy chip giants like NVIDIA, Intel, Qualcomm, and AMD, as well as other startups like Cerebras and SambaNova. Furiosa’s second-gen chip, RNGD (“Renegade”), delivers exceptional power efficiency compared to GPUs and directly addresses concerns about the enormous growth in power consumption for all scales of AI deployment. The chip is designed for inference with advanced large language models and multimodal models, and it’s sampling with customers now.\n\nGartner notes that the GPUs used for advanced Gen AI consume more than 700 watts, with foundries preparing for 2,000-watt GPUs in the not-too-distant future. The cost of powering these chips at scale is now a major consideration for businesses, Gartner finds. And chipmakers must build products that address both capex and opex concerns.\n\nIn its list of recommended actions for the next six to 18 months, the first item is: “Ensure the most cost-efficient product solutions are available by evaluating all the GenAI chip vendors’ offerings, selecting those that provide the best mix of performance, power requirements, and cost.”\n\nYou can learn about RNGD, Furiosa’s power-efficient chip for inference with cutting edge LLMs and multimodal models, at furiosa.ai/rngd .\n\nRNGD is currently sampling with customers who are planning large scale high performance and energy efficient enterprise deployments.\n\n“Gartner, Emerging Tech: Adoption Trends for Energy-Efficient GenAI Semiconductors,” was written by Alan Priestley, Nikita Singh, Menglin Cao, Gaurav Gupta, Joseph Unsworth, and Akhil Singh.\n\nGartner is a registered trademark of Gartner, Inc. and/or its affiliates and is used herein with permission.
