Upgrade the prerequisite packages (the driver and PE Runtime packages).\n2. Upgrade the firmware tool and image if a new version is available.\n3. Perform a cold reboot of the system to apply the changes if the device firmware is upgraded.\n4. Run the `furiosa-smi info` CLI tool to confirm the new driver and firmware versions in all devices.\n5. Upgrade Furiosa-LLM if necessary.\n\nWarning\n\nMake sure to stop all running applications using NPUs before upgrading the SDK.\nOtherwise, the new driver kernel module won’t be loaded.\nIn that case, you will need to reboot the system to load the new driver kernel\nmodule.\n\nPlease follow the steps below to upgrade the Furiosa software stack:\n\n```\nsudo apt update && sudo apt install -y furiosa-driver-rngd furiosa-pert-rngd furiosa-smi\n```\n\nCopy to clipboard\n\nUsually, major releases of the Furiosa SDK include a firmware upgrade.\nThe firmware can be upgraded by running the following command:\n\n```\nsudo apt install -y furiosa-firmware-tools-rngd furiosa-firmware-image-rngd\n```\n\nCopy to clipboard\n\nNote\n\nPlease remember to cold reboot the system after the firmware upgrade process is completed.\nFor more information about the firmware upgrade process, please refer to\n[Upgrading Device Firmware](prerequisites.html#upgradingdevicefirmware).\n\nTo check if the new driver and firmware were installed successfully in all\ndevices, run the following command:\n\n```\n$ furiosa-smi info\n+------+--------+------------------+------------------+---------+---------+--------------+\n| Arch | Device | Firmware         | PERT             | Temp.   | Power   | PCI-BDF      |\n+------+--------+------------------+------------------+---------+---------+--------------+\n| rngd | npu0   | 2024.2.0+7a11888 | 2024.2.1+de20a9f | 30.62°C | 35.00 W | 0000:17:00.0 |\n+------+--------+------------------+------------------+---------+---------+--------------+\n| rngd | npu1   | 2024.2.0+7a11888 | 2024.2.1+de20a9f | 31.41°C | 37.00 W | 0000:2a:00.0 |\n+------+--------+------------------+------------------+---------+---------+--------------+\n```\n\nCopy to clipboard\n\nTo upgrade Furiosa-LLM, use `pip`:\n\n```\npip install --upgrade --upgrade-strategy eager furiosa-llm\n```\n\nCopy to clipboard",
